## Good to see you here!

I am a PhD candidate in the ATLAS Lab, which is a collaboration between the University of Amsterdam and TomTom. The goal of the ATLAS lab, part of the [Innovation Center for Artificial Intelligence (ICAI)](https://icai.ai/) and [Computer Vision Group](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/cv/), is the development new machine learning-based algorithms for high definition map creation for self-driving vehicles. My work is focused on Structured Segmentation, and I am supervised by [Prof. dr. Theo Gevers](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/th.gevers/), [dr. Martin Oswald](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/moswald/) and [dr. Sezer Karaoglu](http://staff.science.uva.nl/~sezerk).

In my work, I mainly focus on leveraging from structure in visual data and implicitly or explicitly imposing structural properties for the tasks of semantic, instance and panoptic segmentation. I explore  possibilities to extend traditional segmentation networks with theories of graphical models.
