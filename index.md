## Good to see you here!

I am a PhD graduate from the ATLAS Lab, a collaboration between the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/) and [TomTom](https://www.tomtom.com/). In January 2026, I publicly defended my thesis titled Visual Understanding of Dynamic Scenes using Object Relationships and Open Vocabularies. I was supervised by [Prof. dr. Theo Gevers](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/th.gevers/), [dr. Martin Oswald](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/moswald/) and [dr. Sezer Karaoglu](http://staff.science.uva.nl/~sezerk). Next to my research, I worked as a teaching assistant in the courses Computer Vision 1, Computer Vision 2 and have supervised master AI students Maksymilian Kulicki and Robin Sasse.

My PhD research mainly focused on open-ended perception in 2D, 3D and video without a human-in-the-loop. Our methods automatically generate target vocabularies from the data itself, allowing for scene-specific, flexible vocabulary adaptation without requiring manual prompting of the vocabulary. We coin these methods _Auto-Vocabulary_ or _Vocabulary-Free_. A second line of work focused on leveraging relational properties for downstream tasks such as instance segmentation.

Currently, I work as a Machine Learning/Computer Vision Engineer in the biotechnology sector to accelerate drug discovery for neurodegenerative diseases with computer vision.

Simultenously, I am building open-ended perception models for real-world use with my own start-up, [Unseen AI](https://unsn.ai).
